When the minix opens up, I typed in root, and entered a new password. 

In minix, type tcpd ftp /usr/bin/in.ftpd & and ifconfig for the IP address.

In terminal, type ftp <IP address>.

Change to the /usr/src/kernel directory in terminal.

Type in main.c and exit to access the local directory.

Edit main.c.

Add a printf statement in the annouce() function.

In terminal, type ftp <IP address> once again, and change to the /usr/src/kernel directory and type put main.c.

In minix, go to the /usr/src directory and type make world.

Once minix is finished recompiled, type reboot.

After minix is rebooted, the message will print in the minix.
