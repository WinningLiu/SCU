Lab 7 Instructions

Step 1:
Locate file proc.c in /usr/src/kernel

Step 2:
Locate the function pick_proc. In side the for loop, 
add a code that will randomly select another queue if the current 
queue is > 3. 

if (random <= 2 && q > 3)
	  {
		  q = (q+4)%NR_SCHED_QUEUES;
	  }

Step 3:
Run make world in /usr/src and reboot. When the system reboots, 
it should take significantly longer than the startup sequence at first.
