Step 1:
When compiled several times, the message in the threads prints 0-9 mostly in order, and on some occasions entirely in order.
Thread i returns in order, although it returns most of the time after thread i+1 has run its message. in some cases, the return statement
runs two times every time a thread prints its message.
It differs from threadHello in that it assigns unique thread numbers to each thread instead of having duplicates. It also prints the threads somewhat 
in order. 

Step 2:
When using mutex locks instead of semaphores, the output runs the same.
