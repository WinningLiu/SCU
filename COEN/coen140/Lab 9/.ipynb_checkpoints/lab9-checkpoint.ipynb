    "\n",
    "This lab demonstrates two different types of ensemble methods, bagging and boosting. Recall that some algorithms (decision trees in this activity) can suffer from high variance. Their results can vary drastically depending on the training data provided. Therefore, the general concept is to build multiple models with multiple subsets of the data to yield a more stable and accurate solution. "

Generally when using random forests the trees are grown to their entirety without pruning which, counterintuitively, does not cause overfitting. Therefore the tuning of these hyperparameters might only cause very marginal gains at best. Below we will experiment with the number of features.\n",
