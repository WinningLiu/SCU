Exercise 2:
Yes the trigger worked. 
After inserting the values into accounts_6, I checked if any data was inserted into
totals_6, and there was data in it.
c1 has 7000. It agrees with the total amount with the custno of c1.

Exercise 3:
The amount for c1 is still 7000.
The amount in totals_6 does not agree with the total amount in accounts_6.

Exercise 4:
Total for c1 is 7000.
The new amount for c1 is 6000 after the update.
The amounts agree with each table.
