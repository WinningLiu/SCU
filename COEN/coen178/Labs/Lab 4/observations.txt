Question 1:
The error rasied says unique constraint violated. We can fix this by adding a distinct in front of last in the select query. 
419 rows were created.
There is nothing in the title column and a salary of 0 for all names.

Question 2:
a) The i makes it so that it is searching without case-sensitivity.
b) 97 rows were inserted into Emp_work table.
c) The deletion did not work. This is due to the fact that Emp_work has a foreign key constraint on AlphaCoEmp, and any deletion or update to a tuple
in AlphaCoEmp would violate that relation.

Question 3:
a) The table was altered successfuly. 
b) Yes.
c) 'Smith" was successfuly deleted from both the AlphaCoEmp table and Emp__work table

Question 4:
a) The procedure compiled without errors.
c) It outputs PL/SQL procedure successfuly completed. If output is set on, then it prints 'Hello' + whatever was passed into the exec.

Question 5:
a) It displays 54, which I would assume would just be a random number between 10 and 100.
