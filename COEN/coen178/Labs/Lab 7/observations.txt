Question 1:
In the test insertion, there is nothing in the budget, startdat and enddate.
Inserting into PastProjects did not work as there were not enough values.

Inserting into ManagedProducts failed since it cannot modify more than one base table
through a join view.

Question 4:
No it did not succeed. It said that itemorder is mutating. 

Question 5:
So that the prereq in the course table can reference it. 
The third prereq did not insert properly. Each course can only have 2 prereqs. 
Right now there are only 2 rows in the prereq table.
There are now 3 rows.
The update did not work. The prereq table is still mutating. 

Question 6:
The constraint that a course cannot have more than 2 prereqs is still enforced, since
(121, 12) was not inserted.
The constraint is still enforced with the update statement.
